🚀 Healthcare Dashboard (Frontend - React & Python Flask)
📝 Project Description
This project demonstrates a dynamic healthcare dashboard with two separate implementations of the frontend:

React.js for a modern, interactive user interface.
Python (Flask) serving as a simple web server to serve static HTML/CSS/JS frontend content.
Both implementations showcase the same healthcare dashboard design, but one is built with React, and the other uses Python Flask to serve the frontend.


🎨 Technologies Used
Frontend (React):
React.js: Frontend library to build interactive user interfaces.
CSS3: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Client-side interactivity.
Frontend (Python Flask):
Flask: Python web framework used to serve static files (HTML, CSS, and JS).
Jinja2: Template engine used in Flask for rendering HTML pages.

🚀 Features
React.js Frontend:

Fully interactive user dashboard.
Real-time validation for the form inputs.
Responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
User interface built with modern React practices.
Python Flask Frontend:

Serves the same dashboard but without React; everything is handled via simple HTML, CSS, and JS.
Flask only serves the static content and renders the dashboard UI.



🔧 Installation
To set up both frontend implementations, follow the steps below for React and Python Flask.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-dashboard.git
cd healthcare-dashboard

2. Frontend: React Application Setup
Navigate to the react-dashboard folder:

cd react-dashboard
npm install

Run the React Application:
npm start
Your React application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

3. Frontend: Python Flask Setup
Install Python and Flask
Make sure Python is installed. Then install Flask:
pip install Flask
Run the Flask Application:
Navigate to the python-dashboard folder and run the Flask app:

cd python-dashboard
python app.py
Your Flask app will be running at http://localhost:5000.

💻 Usage
1. React Frontend:
Once the React app is running, access the healthcare dashboard via http://localhost:3000. The app provides a form for collecting data with immediate validation and feedback.

2. Python Flask Frontend:
Once the Python Flask server is running, access the healthcare dashboard via http://localhost:5000. This implementation uses Python's Flask framework only to serve the frontend files (no complex backend logic is involved).

🎯 How It Works
Frontend (React):
The dashboard is built using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
Users can input data in the form, and React handles all the real-time interactions.
No actual backend integration—React only handles the user interface and form logic.
Frontend (Python Flask):
Flask serves the static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for the frontend, providing a simple way to deliver the dashboard.
Flask doesn't handle complex backend logic in this case—it merely serves as a web server to present the dashboard.
